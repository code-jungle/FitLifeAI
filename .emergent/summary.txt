The AI engineer successfully developed the FitLife AI application from scratch, addressing a comprehensive set of product requirements. The work proceeded chronologically, starting with core infrastructure (React, FastAPI, MongoDB, Gemini AI, Stripe integrations) and then incrementally adding features. Key decisions included using  for LLM and payment, leveraging Shadcn UI for a modern look, and prioritizing responsive design. Significant technical challenges, such as logo redesigns, AI prompt engineering for better output, and implementing secure account deletion, were handled effectively. The AI engineer consistently used testing agents and screenshot tools to validate progress, ensuring functionalities like history management, BMI calculation, dietary restrictions, and a feedback system were robustly implemented. The process highlighted iterative refinement in design and functionality, with the latest work focusing on a feedback system with email integration, which is currently awaiting user-provided SMTP credentials for full activation.

<product_requirements>
The FitLife AI application is a web and mobile PWA offering personalized AI-driven workout and nutrition suggestions, explicitly stating suggestions are AI-generated. It operates on a SAAS model: 7-day free trial, then a single plan for R4,90/month. Gemini AI is used for content generation, and Stripe is intended for payment processing. The visual identity is inspired by Itaú Iti, featuring orange→pink→red gradients, a dark blue-marine background (), glassmorphism effects on cards/headers, and specific typography (Inter, Poppins, Orbitron). Key components include dark/transparent cards with gradient borders, primary gradient buttons, and white icons. The initial build included a landing page with hero, features, CTA, a footer, and authentication. Subsequent features added were: history for viewing/deleting suggestions, hero image replacement, an iteratively refined text-only FitLife AI logo with gradient/glow, enhanced AI text formatting with emojis and no asterisks, a secure account deletion process, password confirmation on registration, display of user's IMC (BMI) with classification, full mobile responsiveness, dietary restrictions input for improved nutrition AI, and a feedback system sending emails to a specified address.

<current_work>
The immediate preceding work focused on implementing a user feedback system. This involved both backend and frontend development. On the backend,  was installed to handle email sending. The  file was updated to include placeholder variables (, ) for SMTP configuration. A new Pydantic model for  was created, and a  endpoint was added to . This endpoint receives feedback data, saves it to MongoDB, and attempts to send an email to  using the configured SMTP settings.

On the frontend, a Enviar Feedback button was added to the footer of the . Clicking this button opens a new  component. This modal provides a form for users to enter their name, email, message, and select a star rating. The frontend includes validation, a loading state, and toast notifications to provide user feedback. Testing confirmed the button and modal functionality, form submission to the backend, and data storage in MongoDB. The email sending part is currently set up but won't send actual emails until the  and  environment variables are properly configured by the user. The system is 95% complete, awaiting this final configuration for live email functionality.
